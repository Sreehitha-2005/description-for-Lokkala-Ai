We aim to preserve, empower, and elevate indigenous craftsmanship by enabling artisans to communicate, learn, and market their work in their native languages using cutting-edge AI technologies.

App/Website Functional Flow (Corrected Version):

We want to create an app or a website where the user must first select their preferred language ‚Äî Telugu (‡∞§‡±Ü‡∞≤‡±Å‡∞ó‡±Å), Hindi (‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä), or English. The language names should be displayed in their respective native scripts.

After selecting a language, the site should navigate to the Login Page, with content displayed in the selected language. The login page should include the following:

Username

Password

"Forgot Password?" option

"Sign In" option (for new users)

"Login" button (for existing users)

If the user selects "Sign In", the site should navigate to a Sign-Up Page that includes:

First Name

Last Name

Mobile Number

Email (Gmail)

A field to enter a strong password

A field to re-enter the password

A "Continue with Google" option

A "Send OTP" button

The system should send an OTP (One-Time Password) to the entered mobile number or email address for verification.

Next, the site should navigate to an OTP Verification Page, where the user can enter a 4-digit OTP using separate square input boxes.

Once the OTP is successfully verified, the user is taken to the Course Selection Page, where they can choose from various available courses such as:

üè∫ Pottery

‚öí Blacksmithing

üßµ Weaving

üåø Herbal Medicine

üåæ Traditional Farming

After selecting a course, the user should be navigated to a Course Content Page that includes:

Audio(User selected language)

Video(Future)

Description(based on the course selected by the user)
 

Work samples

Users who are enrolled in a course should also have the ability to upload their own videos showcasing their work and style. However, to do so, they must first create a profile.
